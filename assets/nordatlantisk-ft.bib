	abstract = {Voting power indexes such as that of Banzhaf are derived, explicitly or implicitly, from the assumption that all votes are equally likely (i.e., random voting). That assumption implies that the probability of a vote being decisive in a jurisdiction with
              n
              voters is proportional to 1/√
              n
              . In this article the authors show how this hypothesis has been empirically tested and rejected using data from various US and European elections. They find that the probability of a decisive vote is approximately proportional to 1/
              n
              . The random voting model (and, more generally, the square-root rule) overestimates the probability of close elections in larger jurisdictions. As a result, classical voting power indexes make voters in large jurisdictions appear more powerful than they really are. The most important political implication of their result is that proportionally weighted voting systems (that is, each jurisdiction gets a number of votes proportional to
              n
              ) are basically fair. This contradicts the claim in the voting power literature that weights should be approximately proportional to √
              n

This chapter explains the present paradoxes and dynamics of the ‘Community of the Realm’, linking the Faroe Islands and Greenland to Denmark by examining its colonial and constitutional history, its internal asymmetries, and its international context. The particularities of the two ‘Danish’ polities are illuminated by comparing the two of them and contrasting them with both neighbours in the North Atlantic and overseas autonomies. The chapter’s main argument is that Denmark greatly enhances the viability of the Community of the Realm by explicitly embracing its dissolution—in the form of Greenlandic and Faroese independence—as its ultimate goal. The chapter concludes that the main obstacles to further loosening the bonds of this ‘ever looser union’ comes not from Danish constitutional law and practice but rather from the United States’ approach to geopolitics and from Faroese and Greenlandic priorities.},

The core of party competition is on the left-right dimension between the four old parties. The Social Democrats and the Social Liberals are on the centre-left side, with the Liberals and the Conservatives on the centre-right side. However, several related developments challenge this core. The four old parties have lost electoral support to new parties. The Danish People’s Party in particular has become a central actor in the Danish party system. New issues like immigration also challenge the internal coherence of the blocs. In terms of party organization, the Danish political parties have undergone a development similar to that of many other Western countries. Party membership has declined significantly, but not disappeared, and public funding plays a central role today. The new parties have also come to resemble the old ones in terms of internal structure.},

            This article introduces and demonstrate the use of a ‘legislative polarisation index’. This extends a current measure of party system polarisation, as developed by Dalton (2008), and makes it possible to include legislative behaviour in the form of roll call votes into the assessment of polarisation. The article selects Denmark and Portugal to illustrate how the index works. The cases show that increased fragmentation and increased polarisation of the party system may become more moderate when parties on the political extremes become included in the legislative process.},

	abstract = {This article proposes a new model of government formation: the Dual Power Base Model. The starting point is the median voter theorem, but an institutional limitation suggested by Laver and Shepsle (2000) is added. The claim is that it takes a certain number of MPs to cope with the practical tasks of running a government — that is, to have ‘Office Capacity’. If the median party has Office Capacity, the model predicts that the median party will form the government. If the median party does not have Office Capacity the median party will choose the closest party or parties that do have Office Capacity. This model is applied most thoroughly to government formation in Denmark, but also to the Norwegian and Swedish cases. When party positions are measured by previous voting behaviour on bills in parliament, the model explains 23 out of 25 government formations in Denmark in the period 1953 to 2007.},

Analysen viser, hvordan diskursen i perioden 2006-2020 har gennemgået flere skift, der hver især vægter de eksterne ambitioner i regionen og de interne hensyn i rigsfællesskabet på forskellig vis. Fra udelukkende at fokusere på det dansk-grønlandske forhold betonede man senere i stedet det regionale udsyn. Det indebar, at Danmarks autoritet blev fremhævet, mens de to andre rigsdeles internationale agens blev nedtonet. I takt med en mere eksplicit erkendelse af, at rigsfællesskabets sammenhængskraft er forudsætningen for Danmarks status som en arktisk stat, er Færøerne og Grønlands betydning blevet mere anerkendt. Det har resulteret i stadig større enighed på tværs af det politiske spektrum om, at et mere ligeværdigt forhold er værd at stræbe efter. En udvikling, der ikke mindst er blevet tilskyndet af omverdenens stigende opmærksomhed.},

While the three countries have all opened the gates and provided access to data—for example, on the voting in parliament, debates, and notes from meetings in committees—the uptake and use of data outside the parliaments is limited. While journalists and academia are users of the open data, hackathons and third-party portals are at an explorative level. Still, there are indicators that hackathons can enhance democracy, and parliamentary data can increase political transparency.},

The literature finds that evidence for such accountability relationships, is, however, also hampered by different uses of roll call votes across time and space.},

It is a large data collection effort containing data on all elected legislators in the 18 Latin American countries with competitive elections since 1978 or transition to democracy up until 2023. The Latin American Legislators Dataset includes data both on unicameral legislatures as well as on the lower and upper chambers in bicameral legislatures and currently comprises 31,724 observations of 21,807 unique legislators in 259 elections. The dataset is an important resource for the study of legislative elites because it comprises information on various legislator attributes (esp. gender, elite turnover, seniority and inter-chamber switching).},

Despite gains for the liberal-conservative Venstre, the incumbent centre-right government led by Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen (Venstre) lost its majority due to substantial losses of the Danish People’s Party and the Liberal Alliance . The new Danish government is a social democratic single party minority government led by Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen . This government is tolerated by the Social Liberals, the Socialist People’s Party as well as the left radical Unity List and constitutes the clearest left-wing majority since the 1971 election . The centre-right camp was split on the tax issue during the whole election period and punished at the ballots despite a sound economy and policy gains on immigration . The Social Democrats benefited from their more restrictive immigration policy by gaining votes from the centre-right parties . They now command the first left-wing majority since the turn of the millennium . However, the ideological differences on immigration policy within the leftist camp will not make governing easier for Frederiksen’s single party minority government . Moreover, the new party “Nye Borgerlige” is the first party to the right of the Danish People’s Party since 1998 in the new Folketing that now consists of ten parties .

Some studies use this rule change to assess whether roll call votes are characterized by more or less party discipline. Cautioning against such simple comparisons I propose to estimate in this article the extent to which members of the European Parliament are subject to party pressure. Comparing the results from the beginning of the sixth and seventh legislative term shows that in final passage votes the average party pressure has decreased considerably after the rule change.},

            Existing United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) voting databases provide excellent coverage of UNGA voting on resolutions adopted by roll-call vote. These databases, however, have known limitations: The United Nations Digital Library only covers final decisions on adopted resolutions, not prior resolution-related decisions nor decisions on failed resolutions. Coverage of roll-call votes in the widely-used database provided by Bailey, Strezhnev and Voeten is broader but reflects limitations in the historical datasets on which the database is built (e.g., the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research dataset). As a result, voting coverage and what is reported vary over time. In this paper, we present a new dataset that expands and improves the consistency of the UNGA decisions covered. We provide comparisons of our database with other UNGA datasets and explore the implications of more complete data for existing and future research.},

Using data from face-to-face interviews with nearly one thousand politicians in 11 countries, together with corresponding surveys of more than twelve thousand citizens, we show that politicians overwhelmingly hold thin, minimalist, “democratic realist” theories of voting, while citizens’ theories are more optimistic and policy oriented. Politicians’ theoretical tendencies—along with their theoretical misalignment from citizens—are remarkably consistent across countries. These theories are likely to have important consequences for how politicians campaign, communicate with the public, think about public policy, and represent their constituents.},

A key element in coalition coordination is coalition agreements, which to a varying degree constrain the behaviour of the coalition partners. This article explores the share of laws that were precisely defined in government agreements and/or legislative agreements, and sets out to explain variation in this share of coalition agreement-based laws. The analyses are based on unique data on legislative as well as governmental coalition agreements entered by three Danish governments with varying parliamentary strength. This study brings the blooming literature on coalition agreements one step further by showing that coalition governance is influenced by government strength. The legislative practice of strong coalition governments is less accommodative but more pre-regulated by coalition agreements.},

We trace the origin of the difference to the 1990s when parties in Eastern Europe chose to emphasize cultural issues to appeal to an electorate unfamiliar with capitalist economics and dissatisfied with the economic left associated with Communism and the economic right associated with painful reforms. To test this assertion we apply the Optimal Classification vote scaling method to an original dataset of over 24,000 votes from 22 European parliaments; the statistical tests support the hypothesis.},

            In the literature on the determinants of party unity, one pathway has remained largely neglected: division of labour. Given their workload, members of parliament (MPs) are only thoroughly concerned with a subset of policies. We argue that this results in MPs casting fewer dissenting votes on matters within their area of specialization since they have had the opportunity to shape the party line there. Regression analyses using data for the German Bundestag support this hypothesis, including four important refinements: Not only the current but also past membership in the responsible committee reduces an MP’s defection probability. Additionally, this pattern is more pronounced for policy spokespersons and for less consequential, i.e., non-legislative votes as well as for issues less salient to the MP’s party. The results have implications for our understanding of MPs’ legislative behaviour, the functioning of parliaments as institutions and for the relationship between parties, MPs and voters.},

We must understand the roll‐call vote institution and account for its selection effects before we can draw inferences about legislative behavior from roll‐call results.

            Using a dyadic approach to explore voting behavior of European Union (EU) member states in the Council of the EU, we investigate the similarity in voting behavior of governments on three policy dimensions: left-right, authoritarian-libertarian, and pro-/anti EU. These policy dimensions are of interest also in other contexts, such as decision-making in international or regional organizations other than the EU. Our dependent variable is based on a new data collection covering the time 2010–2021. Our analysis, employing random effects binary and ordinal logistic regression applied to relations between EU states, confirms that larger distances of governments represented in the Council on these policy dimensions combined are related to larger distances of their vote choices. Larger distances affecting different vote choices within dyads are also confirmed for the pro-/anti EU policy dimension. Moreover, we find that closeness of member states in terms of their budget positions and of domestic public opinion on the EU are related to voting similarities. Member state differences in terms of voting power, by comparison, lead to less divergence of vote choice, for decisions based on the qualified majority voting rule. The length of EU membership, however, does not affect vote choice similarities.},

Insbesondere in den letzten beiden Jahrzehnten lässt sich international ein deutlicher Anstieg von Minderheitsregierungen feststellen. Während Minderheitsregierungen im deutschen Sprachraum oft kritisch betrachtet werden und üblicherweise nur als Notlösung in Ausnahmefällen gelten, sind sie in Skandinavien oder Neuseeland der reguläre Modus des Regierens. Im vorliegenden Literaturbericht wird der aktuelle Forschungsstand zum Regieren von Minderheitskabinetten sowohl auf nationaler als auch auf internationaler Ebene dargelegt. Zunächst wird erörtert, wie Minderheitsregierungen definiert werden und wo sie häufig anzutreffen sind. Anschließend beleuchtet der Bericht die Handlungskalküle von Parteien und erläutert, warum es für sie eine rationale Strategie sein kann, Minderheitsregierungen zu tolerieren, anstatt an der Regierung teilzunehmen. Weiterhin werden die institutionellen und situativen Bedingungen erläutert, unter denen die Bildung von Minderheitsregierungen wahrscheinlicher wird. Es werden auch die verschiedenen Möglichkeiten aufgezeigt, wie Minderheitsregierungen parlamentarische Mehrheiten für die Durchsetzung ihres Programms organisieren können. Abschließend wird die Performanz von Minderheitsregierungen diskutiert, wobei sowohl die Nachteile als auch die zahlreichen normativen Vorteile beleuchtet werden.

            Abstract
            Minority cabinets constitute approximately one third of all governments in established parliamentary democracies internationally. Notably, the past two decades have seen a marked rise in the prevalence of minority governments. In Germany, minority cabinets are often met with skepticism and typically regarded as a contingency measure for exceptional circumstances. In contrast, they are standard practice in the governmental systems of Scandinavia and New Zealand. This literature review outlines the current status of both national and international research on governing under minority cabinets. Initially, it defines minority governments and identifies where they are commonly established. The review then illuminates the strategic considerations of political parties, detailing why tolerating a minority government can be more advantageous than participating in the cabinet. It further explains the institutional and situational conditions that tend to favor the formation of minority governments and explores various strategies through which minority governments secure parliamentary majorities to advance their legislative agendas. Ultimately, the review assesses the performance of minority governments, highlighting not only the potential drawbacks but also the manifold normative benefits.},

	abstract = {A typical distinction for parliaments in parliamentary systems is between a “working” or “debating” parliament. In a “working parliament” the parlia-mentary committees play a vital role. Nevertheless, there still might be differences in the ways committees work. Committees can function as tools for parliament to strengthen the position towards government, function as arenas for partisan competition, or as options for individual MPs to make agreements on allocations of distributional benefits. The expectation is that especially the institutional and partisan explanations apply. Based on information about institutional settings and a selection of activity data, the article investigates the committee system in the Løgting, including when institutional, partisan, and/or distributional characteristics apply. The investigation shows that the committee system in the Løgting adheres to characteristics for a “working parliament” and that a substantial part of the meetings take place in committees but unevenly divided between the committees. Although, the committees have institutional and partisan characteristics, the conditions for partisan behaviour seem stronger. Yet, the oversight committees have stronger institutional charac-teristics but conditioned by limited administrative support in general. For some committees, additional influence from the distributional model is worth considering.

Tingnevndirnar eru tó ikki javnt virknar, men hava sum heild stovnsligar og flokspolitiskar fortreytir at virka eftir, tó eru fortreytirnar fyri flokspolitikk sterkari. Serliga eftirlitsvirksemið hevur stovnslig eyðkenni, men umsitingarliga orkan er sum heild sera avmarkað. Fyri einstakar tingnevndir eru eisini ábendingar um einstaklinga býtispolitisk eyðkenni.},

              EP
              ) use parliamentary questions as a form of fire alarm oversight. We argue that the multilevel nature of the
              EU
              political system allows members of the
              EP
              from national opposition parties to use parliamentary questions to alert the

              uropean Commission to governments' failures to implement
              EU
              policy. Representation in the
              EP
              provides the only avenue for such oversight for national opposition parties. Using a new sample of
              EP
              parliamentary questions, we demonstrate that
              MEPs
              from national opposition parties are more likely to alert the Commission to violations of
              EU
              law in their own member states. These parliamentary questions may lead the Commission to take legal action against member‐state governments.},
