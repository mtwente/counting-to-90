# Introduction

When the government of Denmark only has a narrow majority in parliament, four MPs regularly come into the spotlight: The so-called North Atlantic MPs -- two from Greenland, two from the Faroe Islands -- who usually abstain from voting on matters not concerning Greenland or the Faroe Islands but might be able provide four sometimes crucial votes to form a majority. In this paper, I am going to investigate what role these four MPs tend to play in Folketing: When do they capitalise on their voting power? Do they actually have as much power as the numbers suggest? Or is their influence rather a media frenzy, highlighting a rather unusual trait of day-to-day domestic politics?

There are 179 MPs in Folketinget, the parliament of Denmark. But only 175 of them are elected in Denmark proper, while the remaining four seats are guaranteed for the so-called North Atlantic MPs from Greenland and the Faroe Islands, which both are autonomous members of the Danish Realm today after being under Danish colonial rule for centuries. Their presence in Folketinget can prove important for domestic Danish politics because not all of the four MPs join one (@fig-timeline) of the two party blocs and can thus provide decisive votes for passing legislation and even for securing the national government's stability [@harderFaeroskeOgGronlandske2022, 19]: Several times, both Danish party blocs found themselves with election results where they did not have what is called a "domestic majority" [*indenrigspolitisk flertal*, @buggeRegeringensIndenrigspolitiskeFlertal2023] but instead relied on the North Atlantic MPs to form a majority of 90 seats -- using the Danish expression: to be able to count to 90. Recently, this was the case in 2016 and 2022[^1] [@sorensenEfterBrokBla2022]: In both instances, opposition parties cried foul and called for re-evaluation of the North Atlantic MPs' roles, who have questioned these arrangements themselves as well [e.g. @skaaleFaeroskMFerNordatlantiske2022; @skaale20sporgsmalUS182021; @joensenLagtingsformandenVilAfskaffe2019], even though they have profited from them -- e.g. by being awarded chairmanship of parliamentary commissions [@harderFaeroskeOgGronlandske2022, 13]. <!-- 2023 situation mit moderaterne hinzufügen! -->

[^1]: Even though the North Atlantic MPs' role was discussed extensively in 2022, it was resolved without the North Atlantic MPs by forming an unusual cross-bloc coalition government.

Just as political relations between Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands are being scrutinised time and again in terms of economy, ecology, security and last but not least postcolonialism, so is the position of two MPs elected to Folketinget in Greenland and the Faroe Islands, respectively.
